# Overview

Congratulations! The Doctor<sup>1</sup> has chosen you as the next assistant. The reason, of course, is because of your skills as a mobile developer and that the Doctor would like to bring TARDIS<sup>2</sup> into the world of mobile connected solutions.

Your task as the assistant is to implement some features in React Native and at your disgression. Basically the Doctor realizes your a busy person and its up to you which features to start with and how much to complete. At the very least it would be appreciated if at least one feature in each column below is in a state of progress.

| 1.     | 2.         |
| ------ | ---------- |
| KeyFob | Animations |
| Login  | Native     |
| Manual | Navigation |
|        | TypeScript |

The implementation of the listed features will be described in more detail.

## Dependencies

To bootstrap the project, run the following:

```sh
yarn install
```

You are welcome to install whatever dependencies necessary to accomplish the job. Keep in mind the project has multiple ***yarn*** workspaces and to install the dependency run the following:

```sh
yarn add -W dependency
```

## Server

To accomplish your work a local server is bundled with the starter code. To run the server run:

```sh
yarn run server
```

The server will run on ***localhost:3000***. Any modifications to the server should not be necessary, however, if you feel you really must then it is within bounds to do so.

## Testing

Please test your work. ***jest*** is included as a dependency. Any other testing frameworks that could be of help are allowed and appreciated.

# Features in column 1.

## KeyFob

![KeyFob](./readme_assets/KeyFobScreen.png)

The Doctor would like to be able to lock/unlock the TARDIS. A KeyFob component can be found in the starter code. Modify it to issue a lock/unlock request to the server. The API details to request the */keyfob* endpoint are as follows:

```javascript
// Request
{
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/keyfob'
  method: 'POST'
  headers: {
    authorization: 'access_token'
  }
  body: { type: 'LOCK' } // or { type: 'UNLOCK' }
}

// Response
200, 401, or 404
```

A lock/unlock request is an asynchronous operation in the sense that it requires a secondary GET request to check the status. You will have to poll the GET request at a frequency of your choosing to see if the command is "in_progress" or "completed". The status can be helpful for incorporating animations as found in the ***Animation*** feature. The GET request details are as follows:


```javascript
// Request
{
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/keyfob?type=LOCK', // or type=UNLOCK
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    authorization: 'access_token'
  }
}

// Response
{ "status": "in_progress" } or { "status": "completed" }
```

## Login

![Login](./readme_assets/LoginScreen.png)

A Login component is included in the starter code. The server has the */login* enpoint to authenticate with. The authentication process involves constructing a JWT for the request. The details of the JWT token are as follows.

```javascript
// Contents of JWT
{
    client_id: 'client_id',
    username: 'username',
    password: 'password'
}

/*
The JWT would look like the following:

eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJjbGllbnRfaWQiOiJjbGllbnRfaWQiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InVzZXJuYW1lIiwicGFzc3dvcmQiOiJwYXNzd29yZCJ9.Apw1vCdXsn5pvle-jIsjvf5i-NOW2bGp3BfuPR-gZWc
*/
```

The request would look as follows:

```javascript
{
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/login',
  method: 'POST',
  body: '' // The JWT string
}
```

In response the server will issue a JWT token that contains an access token. The access token field can be used for the "Authorization" header in the ***KeyFob*** feature (or hardcoded given time constraints). If anything is invalid within the request, the server will issue a 401.

[CryptoJS](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) is included as a dependency if you'd like to construct a JWT that way. Other dependencies useful for this are also allowed. You may also just send a JSON body with the contents of the JWT to the */login* endpoint if pressed for time.

## Manual

It would be nice to have a new component that presents TARDIS manual information and assets. The server provides static content for the TARDIS manual and the Doctor is fluent in lorem epsum. All content can be found through a GET request to the */manual* endpoint. To get a JSON with the available content request the */manaul/index.json*. The details of the JSON are similar to as follows.

```json
[
  {
    "image": "navigation.png",
    "title": "Navigation System",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."
  },
  ...
]
```

The images found in the *index.json* are available through requesting */manual* endpoint. 

This is a very open ended feature. Feel free to "wow" the Doctor by creating a new component to display the content in any fashion.

# Features in column 2.

The features in column 2 of the table in the ***Overview*** are more open ended in the sense you are able to use a lot of creative interpretation to complete them.

## Animations

The application is fairly static. Consider adding animations in places like the Login or KeyFob feature to convey progress. Or create an entirely new component and add some fanciful animation. It's really up to you what you'd like to show.

## Native

Display your knowledge of interacting with the native bridge. Enhance a feature such as the Login or KeyFob or even create an entirely new feature with a native extension.

- Bundled database
- Device information
- Local Notifications
- Quick Actions
- Wearables

*Or something else...*

## Navigation

There isn't any navigation solutions in the starter code. Add a dependency to navigate between components or roll your own. The actual navigation flow between screens is up to you.

## TypeScript

The Doctor likes type safety. Implement a portion of the application in TypeScript. You will have to add the respective dependencies to the project.
